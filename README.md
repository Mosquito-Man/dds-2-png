# DDS2PNG Converter (GUI)

A simple Windows tool with drag & drop support to convert `.dds` textures into `.png` or other image formats, using Microsoft’s `texconv.exe` from the [DirectXTex project](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex).

This tool was created for modders and developers who want a straightforward GUI and to be able to mass convert textures instead of typing commands in a console.
